				<description><![CDATA[If blotting only affects us when we were on our period, life &#8230; ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/281/981/bloating-1000-1515512882.jpg?resize=480:*" alt="Natural Remedies To Get Rid of Bloating / Belly Pain" width="787" height="500"/></figure>



<p>If blotting only affects us when we were on our period, life would be a lot easier. But blotting is a common complaint that affects people across the board, no matter your age, size, or where you are in your menstruation. Blame your bloated belly on your body makeup. No, in fact, you can place all the blame on biology: a woman&#8217;s colon, which is 10 cm longer than a male&#8217;s, is constantly competing for space with the bladder, uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes. Furthermore, to prepare us for pregnancy and later excess water retention, our colonies are more of a winding passage with unexpected turns. In the context of the common man, we were born to take birth.</p>



<p>Luckily, there are some things we can do that can stop us from blotting so often. Bustle gave Dr. Robin Chutnuck, MD, an integrated gastroenterologist, founder of the Digestive Center for Women and author of The Bloat Cure: 101 Natural Solutions for Real and Permanent Relief, which says the most basic lifestyle adjustments go a long way Huh. Relieving inflammation is enough to reduce that bloated feeling by making sure you are getting plenty of fiber day-to-day, cutting down on salt, and increasing your water intake.</p>



<p>Even if you are at the top of your game, however, you are bound to suffer unexpected swelling at some point. No need to worry, because Drs. Chutakan says there are natural methods to take care of stomach bloating, indigestion and gas. There are many foods that you can eat (or avoid eating) or activities that you can do, and all these bloated stomach remedies are very simple. If you do not already have any products in your home, you can easily get your hands on your local shops.</p>



<h2>1. Consume Some Plant-Based Probiotics</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2019/6/19/f244696d-7a4b-4591-a0c3-ae7170ef9bee-shutterstock_709299235.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;cs=srgb&amp;q=70" alt="Natural Remedies To Get Rid of Bloating / Belly Pain"/><figcaption>Maja Drazic/Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>



<p>If you and your swollen belly feel blue, then Dr. Chutakan advises you to &#8220;reach for living bacteria that can help correct imbalances in the intestinal flora.&#8221; Not for those who have your stomach flora, or your stomach microbiome, the system of microbes that live in your digestive system that recent research has shown can affect everything from IBS to depression.</p>



<p>Probiotics are your very superheroes that prevent bad bacteria and yeast from accumulating too much in your intestines, which can lead to blotting. The best probiotics contain these strains of good microbes: Lactobacillus acidophilus, Lactobacillus reuteri, and Saccharomyces boulardii. Look at the label to see if any or all of them are inside the package.</p>



<p>Kimchi, Sauerkoot, Tempeh and Kombucha are also reliable options for obtaining probiotics through your diet. Even better is that these probiotics will aid you in easy hunting, which may be the primary cause of your uncomfortable swelling. Dr. Chhukan also says that these foods reduce gas production.</p>



<h2>2. Chew On Fennel Seeds Or Drink Fennel Tea</h2>



<p>You might not have fennel just lying around (unless you&#8217;re experimenting with fancy Jamie Oliver recipes), but it&#8217;s an easy thing to scoop to your nearest health food store or online. &#8220;Eat a pinch of fennel seeds at the end of a meal to benefit from gas reducing oils,&#8221; Dr. Chutakan Bustle explains. This can be especially helpful if you have eaten your fair share of delicious vegetables like broccoli, and you may already feel the stomach slightly bloated, (something that is completely natural, by the way). This is a good way to wrap a large plate of carbs.</p>



<p>For those of you who do not want to chew on fennel seeds like chipmunk (as tasty as they are), you have options. Dr. Chutakan says that you can put crushed or whole seeds in a cup of boiling water and sip on it. There is always an option to sprinkle them on top of your next meal.</p>



<h2>3. Sip On Water With Freshly-Squeezed Lemon Juice</h2>



<p>Drinking lots of water is important for digestive health, Dr. Chutakan says, but when many people say that lemonade specifically helps to &#8220;flush out&#8221; your system, it really is more than a myth. Naturopathic doctor Erica Matluk, ND, NP, told Well + Good that there really isn&#8217;t enough research on the benefits of lemonade to claim that it is doing nothing other than hydrating you (which of course Is a good thing!).</p>



<p>Citric acid that gives lemons the flavor of their fritters can help break down or prevent kidney stones, a 2014 study found, a stomach ailment they can help with. Lemon is also a source of soluble fiber, a 2011 study that can help reduce constipation and, in turn, blotting &#8211; but to get this benefit, Healthline writes, you need lemon pulp Will have to eat.</p>



<p>Drinking water with or without lemons helps your body move nutrients rapidly through your system, so keeping it normally hydrated is a good idea if you want to fight bloating successfully.</p>



<h2>4. Be Mindful Of The Beans You Eat</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2019/6/19/ca07cb2a-c360-4bdd-8a2e-f1d25a3bd35f-shutterstock_281102513.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;cs=srgb&amp;q=70" alt="Natural Remedies To Get Rid of Bloating / Belly Pain"/><figcaption>AS Food studio/Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>



<p>You can pat yourself on the back while adding the chickpeas to your salad, thinking how much protein you are giving your adult. But if you&#8217;re not already eating beans on reggae, the Cleveland Clinic writes, the extra fiber they bring to your diet can increase bloating. When the sugars in the beans break down, they can produce gas. Soaking beans overnight is known as a method to make them easier on digestion, but curing canned beans should be fine.</p>



<h2>5. Drink Less Coffee</h2>



<p>I have some bad news: Coffee naturally dehydrates, increases acid production, and irritates your GI tract, which all rolls up the red carpet for blotting. But we live in the real world and, for many of us, in order to remedy a bloated stomach, kissing coffee goodbye is simply not an option. Dr. Chutanak suggests limiting yourself to a cup of coffee or may help prevent bloat related to coffee in a day.</p>



<h2>6. Eat Ginger Or Drink Ginger Tea</h2>



<p>Ginger has been used for centuries to cure all types of basic diseases. The two compounds called ginger and shogol found in this root reduce inflammation in your intestine and send a strong message to cool your intestinal muscles. There are a few different ways to effectively get ginger into your system, but unfortunately, those sugared ginger are not one of the chewers.</p>



<p>Instead, cut some very thin slices of ginger and steep them in boiling water for 10 minutes. You can add a squeeze of honey and lemon to it to make it tastier before filling it. You can also chew on small pieces of raw ginger for quick fix, if you don&#8217;t like the taste. Powdered ginger root, which you can take daily as a supplement, is also an option.</p>



<h2>7. Do A Few Simple Yoga Moves</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2019/6/19/ae34b539-29be-4144-ad40-9e8401736a55-shutterstock_207304351.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;cs=srgb&amp;q=70" alt="Natural Remedies To Get Rid of Bloating / Belly Pain"/><figcaption>Luna Vandoorne/Shutterstock</figcaption></figure>



<p>This not only reduces muscle and joint pain, but also relieves yoga when your digestive system gets all messed up. There are a few different asanas that you can do at home to reduce inflammation and reduce any pain in your stomach that may result.</p>



<p>Start with apanasana, which is basically lying on your back and resting your knees in your chest. You can then bring your knees aside and take a twisted twist and allow your head to fall in the opposite direction. The dog facing downward and turning forward is simple and effective; They are easy reversals that encourage blood flow to your lower half. Whichever posture you choose, hold them for a few minutes at a time to get maximum results.</p>



<h2>8. Cook Grains &amp; Legumes With Kombu</h2>



<p>It may sound like an ominous planet from the Star Trek series, but the kombu is an edible seaweed-like marine flora from Japan for its anti-digestive properties, at least according to the Internet. A 2008 parent article cited research on Tyne of the University of Newcastle, a substance found in sewage, has benefits in digestion, and claimed that kombu contains enzymes that pre- Digestive beans help, although note what enzymes they are.</p>



<p>Dr. Chutanak recommends that when you cook your next batch of beans, lentils, or grains such as quinoa, add a little kombu to the pot. If nothing else, it tastes bright and is a delicious source of extra fiber.</p>



<h2>9. Snack On A Banana</h2>



<p>You can use some extra fiber in your life to move things around if you are uncomfortably bloated. Ripe bananas are known to aid digestion and bowel movements, and the potassium found in this fruit manages the fluid levels in your body that are causing inflammation.</p>



<p>It is worth noting, however, that the unholy banana Harvard T.H. According to &#8220;sources of resistant starch&#8221;. Chain School of Public Health, which means that those systems can be a little harder on the short-term. &#8220;Starch serves as a food for the development of beneficial microbes in the digestive system,&#8221; Harvard wrote, which, if we remember what we previously learned about beans, would in the long-term enhance the healthy gut environment. May boost, but causes short-term buildup of gas. So if you like those green bananas, either make them part of your daily rotation or be careful about eating them.</p>



<h2>10. Try Eliminating Dairy</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2019/10/23/2c7bf0ac-8158-441e-bf11-904915cd9c6c-getty-667807194.jpg?w=646&amp;fit=max&amp;auto=format%2Ccompress&amp;cs=srgb&amp;q=70" alt="Natural Remedies To Get Rid of Bloating / Belly Pain"/><figcaption>Tristan Fewings/Getty Images News/Getty Images</figcaption></figure>



<p>Even though being gluten free these days, it is more likely that you have lactose intolerance than gluten sensitivity. Lactose is the main sugar in milk, and for it to be properly processed in your body, you need an enzyme called lactase. Babies have plenty of use because they need it to digest breastmilk, but as we get older, we produce less and less lactase because we no longer need milk. This makes it extremely difficult for the digestive system to break down cow&#8217;s milk and other dairy products in the same way that it causes abdominal bloating.</p>



<p>Fortunately, we live in an era in which there is a Gajian type of non-dairy milk. Try swapping your latte for a decoction of oat milk for a few weeks and see how you feel.</p>



<p>Natural remedies for blotting can help when you are not feeling so hot for a few days. But if your bloat lasts more than a few days at a time and interferes with your day-to-day life, keep a journal of your symptoms and food intake to talk to your doctor about potential culprits. Together, you can find out what is wrong, and you can treat it as fast as you can.</p>

				<description><![CDATA[Women talk more about their bodies than ever before, but one common &#8230; ]]></description>
								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/281/766/natural-laxatives-main-1516714448.jpg?resize=480:*" alt="Try These Natural Ways To Relieve Constipation" width="758" height="482"/></figure>



<p>Women talk more about their bodies than ever before, but one common problem is still very expensive: constipation.</p>



<p>Okay, we&#8217;re here to change that! After all, research shows that 16% of women suffer from constipation regularly, but most of us treat it every time. Fun fact: Constipation is more common in women than in men, possibly due to hormones. Yes, there is no end to the list of things that can ruin your bathroom habits. Think: Your monthly cycle, diet changes, stress, sleep problems, even travel. Seriously, what&#8217;s the last thing?</p>



<p>If you think you have an obstruction, don&#8217;t wait more than two or three days to deal with it, says Lisa Ganju, a gastroenterologist and clinical associate professor of medicine. &#8220;Your body is going to tell you this is unpleasant, so be careful,&#8221; she said.</p>



<p>Also, one good news: it is very easy to move your intestines without medication. “Natural nutrients are definitely more acceptable than some prescription nutrients, and a little bit softer than what you get over the counter,” she says. Bonus: some of them are already hanging in your fridge or pantry. Rescue!</p>



<p>Here we share eight natural nutrients that can revitalize your bathroom habits. Better yet, include them in your regular diet to keep things straight:</p>



<h2>Water</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image is-resized"><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/281/766/2018/01/09/natural-laxatives-1-water-1516714393.jpg?resize=480:*" alt="Try These Natural Ways To Relieve Constipation" width="684" height="435"/></figure>



<p>Just as hydration is good for the rest of your body, it also helps your digestive system. &#8220;Water basically lubricates everything and softens feces,&#8221; says Ganju. &#8220;The whole point of getting stool to the colon is to absorb the excess water [across the road] and try to strengthen it.&#8221;</p>



<p>The colon is very long, but for a long time the water goes out of it and eventually becomes rocky. “Getting the fluid back into your body helps to keep the feces soft and the colon empty,” she says.</p>



<p>This easy water bottle hack will help you stay hydrated properly every day:</p>



<h2>Greek yogurt</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/281/766/2018/01/09/natural-laxatives-2-greek-yogurt-1516714399.jpg?resize=480:*" alt="Try These Natural Ways To Relieve Constipation"/></figure>



<p>Yogurt and other probiotics are generally good for your gut and digestion. &#8220;If you have diarrhea or constipation, probiotics can help your intestines because they reset your intestinal microbiota,&#8221; says Ganju. “We all have a billion bacteria out there that if left untreated, it can cause indigestion, bloating and changes in the gut. Probiotics add healthy bacteria to your gut and reproduce the digestive system with good bacteria.</p>



<h2>Leafy greens</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/281/766/2018/01/09/natural-laxatives-3-leafy-greens-1516714283.jpg?resize=480:*" alt="Try These Natural Ways To Relieve Constipation"/></figure>



<p>Greens like spinach, kale and cabbage are very dense in fiber, and your system really needs to move it. &#8220;That fiber forces the colon to shrink &#8211; it gives it fullness and it wants to be pushed out,&#8221; says Ganju.</p>



<p>Considering the fact that most people aren&#8217;t close to the recommended 25g of fiber per day, eating leafy vegetables is a quick way to jumpstart your digestive track. Additionally, leaf chalk contains plenty of magnesium (a nutrient that most Americans do not), which helps neutralize feces.</p>



<h2>Aloe vera</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/281/766/2018/01/09/natural-laxatives-4-aloe-vera-1516714369.jpg?resize=480:*" alt="Try These Natural Ways To Relieve Constipation"/></figure>



<p>You may have used aloe for sunburn or other beauty products, but you may have noticed recently that it is on the shelves of your grocery store, mostly in the form of juice. &#8220;Aloe is one of the natural nutrients that people take,&#8221; says Ganju. &#8220;It lubricates the feces a little bit, which makes it easier to pass.&#8221;</p>



<p>Aloe contains 75 vitamins, enzymes, minerals and sugar, as well as anthraquinones, a natural nutrient-rich compound that increases the amount of water in your intestines, produces more mucus, and increases body contractions. Your GI System. (Take your energy in just 8 weeks with 20 minutes of work outs in a preventive toning exchange!)</p>



<h2>Chia seeds</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/281/766/2018/01/09/natural-laxatives-5-chia-seeds-1516714377.jpg?resize=480:*" alt="Try These Natural Ways To Relieve Constipation"/></figure>



<p>If chia seeds are placed in water, they become a kind of jelly. Ganju says it helps them like natural nutrients. &#8220;In your system, when chia seeds are mixed with liquid, they expand and the gel-like structure makes it easier to move through the intestine,&#8221; she explains.</p>



<p>Considering the fact that there are 10 grams of fiber in one ounce, you are guaranteed to get some chia seeds in your diet.</p>



<h2>Flaxseeds</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/281/766/2018/01/09/natural-laxatives-6-flax-seeds-1516714368.jpg?resize=480:*" alt="Try These Natural Ways To Relieve Constipation"/></figure>



<p>According to the USDA, one tablespoon flax seed contains three grams of fiber, making it easy to snack on smoothies or salads. “Extra fiber stimulates the intestines,” says Ganju.</p>



<p>The seeds contain “mucus,” which circulates your digestive tract and moves the bowel movements more smoothly. Flaxseed is high in magnesium, so it will stimulate the rush.</p>



<h2>High-fiber fruits</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/281/766/2018/01/09/natural-laxatives-7-high-fiber-fruit-1516714461.jpg?resize=480:*" alt="Try These Natural Ways To Relieve Constipation"/></figure>



<p>Like greens, some fruits contain fiber. Collect fresh fruit such as berries, which &#8220;provide fiber, but don&#8217;t make you gas like greens, apples and pears,&#8221; says Ganju. Additionally, the antioxidants in berries have anti-inflammatory properties that facilitate your GI system.</p>



<p>Apricots, dry fruits like figs and &#8211; shocker &#8211; plums are also a good choice. &#8220;Dehydrated foods contain dense fiber and extra sugar, which increases bowel function,&#8221; she said.</p>



<h2>Oils</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/281/766/2018/01/09/natural-laxatives-8-oils-1516714404.jpg?resize=480:*" alt="Try These Natural Ways To Relieve Constipation"/></figure>



<p>Eat a little olive oil, mineral oil, flax seed oil or castor oil to ease your gut. &#8220;I am referring to a lot of olive oil or mineral oil,&#8221; says Ganju. “Drink a tablespoon. It will get into your digestive tract and soften the stool, making it slightly slippery or soft, so it won&#8217;t hurt when you try to get into the rough stool. &#8220;</p>



<p>If you are upset about the idea of ​​pushing back the olive oil, use the oil as a cooking agent or as a salad dressing. Keep in mind that this natural laxative option is not calorie-free. One tablespoon contains 120 calories.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Improving your diet and hair care routine are easy steps to strengthen your hair. Eat healthy foods that are rich in vitamins and minerals, which enhance hair durability and shine. Avoid harmful habits and choose products that moisturize your hair.</p>



<h2>1. Getting Good Nutrition</h2>



<p><strong> 1.  Take a biotin supplement or add biotin-containing foods into your diet</strong>. Biotin is a B-complex vitamin that helps the body to develop a protein called keratin that causes hair loss. Eat 2,500 mg of biotin supplement daily to strengthen your hair. [1] You can get low amounts of biotin from the following foods: [2]</p>



<ul><li> Eggs</li><li> Seeds and seeds</li><li> Avocados</li><li> Sweet Potato</li><li> Salmon</li><li> Liver </li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/e8/Strengthen-Hair-Step-1-Version-2.jpg/aid6255635-v4-728px-Strengthen-Hair-Step-1-Version-2.jpg.webp" alt="How to Strengthen Your Weak Hairs &amp; Add Volume"/></figure>



<p><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Eat more calcium and Vitamin D</strong> Calcium plays a strong role in maintaining healthy hair while Vitamin D helps your body absorb calcium. Eat milk daily or eat other dairy products like yogurt and cheese to get the calcium. Vitamin D is found in fish, whole grains and fortified orange juices. [3]<br> Talk to your doctor about vitamin D and calcium intake.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/6/63/Strengthen-Hair-Step-2-Version-2.jpg/aid6255635-v4-728px-Strengthen-Hair-Step-2-Version-2.jpg.webp" alt="How to Strengthen Your Weak Hairs &amp; Add Volume"/></figure>



<p><strong>3. Make sure your diet is rich in protein</strong>. Protein is important in preventing weak and dry hair. Eat protein in your daily diet and breakfast to keep your hair strong and healthy. Choose foods that contain protein: [4]<br> Meat, poultry and fish<br> Eggs<br> Milk and other dairy products<br> Legumes and nuts<br> Shake or smoothies with whey protein</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/dd/Strengthen-Hair-Step-3-Version-2.jpg/aid6255635-v4-728px-Strengthen-Hair-Step-3-Version-2.jpg.webp" alt="How to Strengthen Your Weak Hairs &amp; Add Volume"/></figure>



<p><strong>4. Maintain a healthy iron level to avoid hair loss</strong>. Iron levels in the blood limit the supply of nutrients to your hair spindles and hinder its growth. If you suspect that your iron levels are low, ask your doctor if iron supplements are right for you. You should aim to eat iron-containing foods every day: [5].<br> Red meat<br> Chicken<br> Fish<br> Lentils<br> Lettuce<br> Broccoli<br> Kale</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/f/fa/Strengthen-Hair-Step-4-Version-2.jpg/aid6255635-v4-728px-Strengthen-Hair-Step-4-Version-2.jpg.webp" alt="How to Strengthen Your Weak Hairs &amp; Add Volume"/></figure>



<p><strong>5. Get more vitamin C to increase collagen production</strong>. Collagen strengthens hair shafts, resulting in healthy hair. Vitamin C helps your body produce other benefits, such as helping your body absorb collagen and iron. To get vitamin C, eat at least 1-2 servings of foods per day: [6]<br> Orange<br> Blueberry<br> Black Currents<br> Strawberry<br> Yams<br> Broccoli<br> Ear<br> Name</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/c3/Strengthen-Hair-Step-5-Version-2.jpg/aid6255635-v4-728px-Strengthen-Hair-Step-5-Version-2.jpg.webp" alt="How to Strengthen Your Weak Hairs &amp; Add Volume"/></figure>



<p><strong>6. Eat foods that give your hair thick mineral silica.</strong> Silica strengthens your hair by making it more durable and preventing cracking. Eat silica-containing foods like banana, raisins and oats several times a week. You can get silica from beer grains. [7]<br> Men should not drink more than 2 beers every day and women should not exceed 1 beer.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/e/eb/Strengthen-Hair-Step-6-Version-2.jpg/aid6255635-v4-728px-Strengthen-Hair-Step-6-Version-2.jpg.webp" alt="How to Strengthen Your Weak Hairs &amp; Add Volume"/><figcaption> </figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>7. Drink 6-8 glasses of water a day to prevent dehydration</strong>. Dehydrated hair and weak hair can easily break or break. To stay hydrated, drink at least 6-8 glasses of water or 6–8 cups (1.4–1.9 liters) per day. If you don&#8217;t want to drink too much, try to reach this level by drinking herbal tea and juice. [8]<br> You can also stay hydrated by eating watery foods such as watermelon or cucumber.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/c/ce/Strengthen-Hair-Step-7-Version-2.jpg/aid6255635-v4-728px-Strengthen-Hair-Step-7-Version-2.jpg.webp" alt="How to Strengthen Your Weak Hairs &amp; Add Volume"/></figure>



<p></p>



<h2>2. Preventing Hair Damage</h2>



<p><strong>1. Avoid washing your hair more than 3-4 times a week.</strong> Shampooing your hair every day can damage its natural oils and cause it to break down. Wash your hair daily to keep your hair healthy. If your hair feels swollen or fatty while washing, try a dry shampoo to absorb sweat and oil from your scalp. [9]<br> When applying dry shampoo, keep 8-10 inches (20-25 cm) away from your scalp.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/0/0f/Strengthen-Hair-Step-8-Version-2.jpg/aid6255635-v4-728px-Strengthen-Hair-Step-8-Version-2.jpg.webp" alt="How to Strengthen Your Weak Hairs &amp; Add Volume"/></figure>



<p><strong>2. Limit heat styling twice a week</strong>. Using blow dryers, curling irons and straightening tools in your hair can cause dryness and fragility, which can weaken your hair. Dry your hair as much as possible before heating and styling to reduce heating time. లలో On warm days, dry your hair and go for a natural look. [10]<br> Apply a heat protection product to minimize damage when styling your hair.<br> If possible, stop heat styling for a few months to restore your hair luster.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/d/d8/Strengthen-Hair-Step-9-Version-2.jpg/aid6255635-v4-728px-Strengthen-Hair-Step-9-Version-2.jpg.webp" alt="How to Strengthen Your Weak Hairs &amp; Add Volume"/></figure>



<p><strong>3. Dry your hair with an old T-shirt rather than a napkin</strong>. Drying your hair can be tricky and cumbersome, especially if you do it tight. Instead, gently brush your hair with a cotton T-shirt. Exhaust the maximum moisture and dry your hair and air. [11]<br> If you want to use a napkin to dry your hair, use a microfiber towel.<br> The T-shirt works best for people with curly hair because it helps control the fridge.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/9/9d/Strengthen-Hair-Step-10-Version-2.jpg/aid6255635-v4-728px-Strengthen-Hair-Step-10-Version-2.jpg.webp" alt="How to Strengthen Your Weak Hairs &amp; Add Volume"/></figure>



<p><strong>4. Instead of a brush, comb your hair with a wide tooth comb</strong>. Brushing too thin or mature hair can cause cracks and weaken your hair. Instead, slide a wide-toothed comb through your hair to remove complex knots and knots. To make things easier, first start removing the knots on the bottom of your hips, then target the mats at the top. [12]<br> If you have curly or wavy hair, it is important to use a wide tooth comb.<br> For most curly hair, apply some conditioner before trying to comb through your hair.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/4/4a/Strengthen-Hair-Step-11.jpg/aid6255635-v4-728px-Strengthen-Hair-Step-11.jpg.webp" alt="How to Strengthen Your Weak Hairs &amp; Add Volume"/></figure>



<p><strong>5. Quit smoking to avoid hair loss.</strong> Smoking disrupts the blood vessels that supply nutrients to the scalp and weakens the hair. [13] If you are a smoker, ask your doctor about the best options to help you quit. Nicotine re-establishment therapy, prescription medications, and behavioral therapy are all effective measures to break this habit. [14]<br> Nicotine restoration therapy comes in the form of gum, patches, inhalers, sprays or lotions.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/84/Strengthen-Hair-Step-12.jpg/aid6255635-v4-728px-Strengthen-Hair-Step-12.jpg.webp" alt="How to Strengthen Your Weak Hairs &amp; Add Volume"/></figure>



<p></p>



<h2>3. Using the Right Products</h2>



<p><strong>1. Wash your hair with sulfate-free shampoo to protect natural oils. </strong>Shampoos that do not contain sulfate contain tougher detergents than regular shampoos, which can cause drought. Shop for shampoos that say “sulfate-free” in the bottle and maintain strong and thick hair. You can find organic and chemical shampoos at health food stores or online. [15]<br> Using a small amount of shampoo to wash your hair will reduce dryness. Shampoo your hair and roots and fix the conditioner at the ends of your hair.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/8/80/Strengthen-Hair-Step-13.jpg/aid6255635-v4-728px-Strengthen-Hair-Step-13.jpg.webp" alt="How to Strengthen Your Weak Hairs &amp; Add Volume"/></figure>



<p><strong>2. Buy shampoo with pepper or eucalyptus to stimulate hair growth.</strong> Peppermint and eucalyptus oil improve blood flow to your hair follicles and promote hair growth. When shampooing, massage the product directly into your scalp for 30 seconds. You should feel a tingling and this is a sign of what is working. [16]<br> Alternatively, add 1-2 drops of peppermint oil or eucalyptus oil to the foot size of a regular shampoo and mix it in your hands</p>



<p><strong>3. Buy hair products with shea butter, olive oil, argan oil or coconut oil.</strong> When it’s dry, you need moisturizing elements to keep your hair hydrated. Shop for shampoos and conditioners that contain natural ingredients to restore moisture. Shea butter, olive oil, argan oil or coconut oil coating are popular options for strengthening your hair and preventing hair breakage. [18]<br> Argan oil and coconut oil have the added benefit of adding a sweet scent to your hair and can be applied to dry hair, smoother or brighter.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/2/27/Strengthen-Hair-Step-15.jpg/aid6255635-v4-728px-Strengthen-Hair-Step-15.jpg.webp" alt="How to Strengthen Your Weak Hairs &amp; Add Volume"/></figure>



<p><strong>4. Use avocado oil as a mask,</strong> conditioner or scalp massage treatment. Avocado oil has serious moisturizing properties that prevent dryness of the scalp and hair and brighten your locks. Avocado oil can be purchased online or at health food stores or supermarkets. Write on your hair once a week: [19]<br> Apply a few drops of it on your fingertips and massage your scalp.<br> After shampooing it is used as a quarter size conditioner.<br> Make a hair mask with 1 tbsp (15 ml) 1 tbsp (15 ml) honey and 1 egg yolk. (Rinse with very cold water to avoid cooking eggs on your hair.)<br> Using a store-bought deep conditioner that contains avocado oil.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://www.wikihow.com/images/thumb/1/10/Strengthen-Hair-Step-16.jpg/aid6255635-v4-728px-Strengthen-Hair-Step-16.jpg.webp" alt="Image titled Strengthen Hair Step 16"/></figure>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>It is important to remember that everyone has different metabolic rates. Exercising regularly, getting enough sleep, and drinking plenty of water are three good things you can do to speed up your metabolism. However, you can do this effectively by eating properly.</p>



<p>Today, we share a list of foods that can help boost your metabolism. Incorporate these foods into your daily diet and watch the pounds fall.</p>



<h3>10. Hot peppers</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_25/259510/7504360-chili-499062_960_720-1477880095-650-05cd01b0b2-1478683782.jpg" alt="List of 10 Foods to Boost Metabolism"/></figure>

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pixabay.com/es/chile-rojo-fuerte-especias-499062/" target="_blank">© pixabay</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Studies show that eating hot peppers slows down your metabolism by 25%.</p>



<p>If you are sweating more than usual due to spicy eating, it is caused by capsaicin, a compound that stimulates the body&#8217;s pain receptors. It boosts blood circulation and metabolism and makes your body burn fat faster.<br>

<p>If you want to increase your metabolic rate, it is important to eat plenty of calcium-rich foods.</p>



<p>A study at the University of Tennessee found that people who consume 1,200 to 1,300 milligrams of calcium per day are more likely to lose weight than those who consume less.</p>



<h3>1. Omega-3 fatty acids</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_25/259510/7504760-walnuts-552975_960_720-1477881612-650-0cd5966e05-1478683782.jpg" alt=""/></figure>

<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://pixabay.com/es/nueces-frutos-secos-saludable-552975/" target="_blank">© pixabay</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Omega-3 fatty acids are found mainly in fish, but they are also found in nuts, seeds, flax and hemp seed oil.</p>



<p>These foods speed up your metabolism because they reduce the production of a hormone called leptin (a natural chemical that slows down your metabolism).</p>



<p>In fact, a study done by the Mayo Clinic found that African tribes had high levels of leptin in their diet.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One day, constantly tired, I asked myself, &#8220;What do Japanese women do to get flawless porcelain skin, thin and toned shapes?&#8221; After doing a little research, I discovered the Japanese custom of drinking water on an empty stomach as soon as I woke up every morning.</p>



<p>According to many studies, this simple exercise has positive effects on various health conditions. I decided to give it a try, and today I want to share my experience with Bright Side readers.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know what to do to make it more powerful. My skin and hair seemed to be blurry and my body was sending me signs that it was not working properly.</p>



<p>Tired of visiting doctors who were telling me the same thing and prescribing more pills, I inquired about Japanese hydrotherapy and immediately put it into practice. The results are amazing!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you exercise regularly, eat healthy, and lose weight, we all produce a hormone called cortisol.</p>



<p>This is important because it puts the respondent at risk. However, persistent use of high levels of cortisol causes many problems that can be identified in Cushing&#8217;s syndrome.</p>



<p>The most common way to produce this consistently is when you are under constant pressure. This is why cortisol is also known as stress hormone. It produces a lot of muscle, destroys metabolism and creates abdominal fat.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>To get rid of that extra weight, all you have to do is drop some habits and replace them.</p>



<p>To help you look better in just 4 weeks, we&#8217;ve added some recommendations on Bright Side. All of these things require less effort, but they can really change your look and appearance.</p>



<h3>Swap canned vegetables for frozen ones</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_22/220955/13225310-15167605-0103-1471427433-650-8-1488295420-650-1586de8f80-1492086223.jpg" alt="You May Have Tried A Lot Methods BUT! Try These Great Ways to Stay in Shape:"/></figure>

<h3>Candied fruits and nuts instead of&nbsp;sweets</h3>

<p>Whenever you go to a restaurant, you consume thousands of calories. If you have a salad with low-fat broth or a light dressing before you go out, you can easily reduce the amount you eat at the restaurant by 20-30%. For example, you may find that you eat fewer pizza slices than you eat completely. This will help you avoid getting 5-7 kg (11-15 ft) per year.</p>

<p>We have long known that different smells affect your appetite. For example, the smell of bananas, pears and apples can reduce your appetite and reduce the craving for something sweet. So if you want to eat that extra cookie, swap it out for pear or squeeze it into its smell.</p>

<p>Eating a healthy and nutritionally balanced diet has been scientifically proven to radiate positive vibes, but it can be difficult to maintain when you have a bad day and dive into a pot of Nutella.</p>



<p>These 9 simple foods are proven to reverse your frown and aid weight loss. The list includes chocolate (yes, you heard us correctly), coffee, and even pasta. Eat these delicious foods, and you&#8217;ll be glowing in no time!</p>



<h3>1. Chocolate</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_24/249110/7177310-dark-chocolate2-1476454204-650-2df5bb9de9-1476689886.jpg" alt="Foods that Improves Your &amp; Partner's Mood :*"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://brightside.me/inspiration-health/9-foods-you-need-to-improve-your-mood-249110/#image7177510"></a></p>



<p><a href="http://www.afternoonrecipes.com/why-the-dark-chocolate-is-very-good-for-your-health/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">© afternoonrecipes.com</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thinking about chocolate brings a smile to our face, but surely you cannot attend this treatment and still lose weight and be happy? Okay, here we are telling you that you can. Chocolate contains many antioxidants, including magnesium, which triggers your vessels to relax, lowering blood pressure and increasing your circulation. Embracing a few sections of a 70% cocoa bar will not only reduce your anxiety, but will also reduce PMS, depression, and fatigue. So feel free to eat dark chocolate 2-3 times a week.

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>In the modern world, everyday products can hide various traps. Many people do not bother to read the information written on the label and think that they already know how to know about certain products. But sometimes, they are so wrong.</p>



<p>Bright Side has collected some surprising facts about products that we all eat almost every day.</p>



<h3>Pringles aren’t made from potatoes.</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_58/584110/4302710-14809210-9_1-0-1508417425-1508417434-0-1534431597-0-1534432797-1534432802-650-1-1534432802-650-0bbdb11ca8-1534758311.jpg" alt="10 Food Products That Can Be Surprising"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://brightside.me/creativity-cooking/10-food-products-that-can-be-full-of-surprises-584110/#image4303410"></a></p>



<p><a href="https://pixabay.com/ru/pringles-%D1%87%D0%B8%D0%BF%D1%81%D1%8B-%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B0-331944/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">© pixabay.com</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://pixabay.com/ru/%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%85%D0%BE%D0%B4-%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%BD-%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BA%D1%80%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%85%D0%B5%D0%BC%D1%8B-2179178/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">© pixabay.com</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>These chips are made with a special kind of flour. This includes wheat, rice, corn flour and dehydrated potato flakes. These are thin dough pieces fried, dried, and with powdered spices and other flavor enhancing sprays.</p>



<h3>Almonds, peanuts, and pistachios aren’t nuts.</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_58/584110/4302760-14809510-8_-0-1508418209-1508418630-0-1534431636-0-1534433009-1534433020-650-1-1534433020-650-985fafe650-1534758311.jpg" alt="10 Food Products That Can Be Surprising"/></figure>

<p>From the botanical point of view, a nut is a &#8220;fruit&#8221; inside a hard fruit that does not open under natural conditions. &#8220;True&#8221; nuts are hazelnuts, chestnuts and acorns. An almond is a seed and a peanut is related to beans. Pistachios, walnuts and pine nuts are stones or seeds.</p>



<h3>Carrots may have different colors.</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_58/584110/4302810-photo-1452724222179-950de6f4a3ce-1507630725-650-a072bddba0-1534758311.jpg" alt="10 Food Products That Can Be Surprising"/></figure>

<p>People started breeding orange carrots only in the 17th century. Earlier, there were purple, white and red carrots.</p>



<h3>100% natural juice can’t be&nbsp;packaged.</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_58/584110/4302860-14808810-12-0-1508417510-1508417542-0-1534431654-0-1534432763-1534432766-650-1-1534432766-650-4fee34c824-1534758311.jpg" alt="10 Food Products That Can Be Surprising"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://brightside.me/creativity-cooking/10-food-products-that-can-be-full-of-surprises-584110/#image4303560"></a></p>



<p><a href="https://www.foodiesfeed.com/free-food-photo/fruit-juices-in-supermarket/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">© foodiesfeed.com</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>To keep the juice fresh for a long time, the fruits are artificially deprived of oxygen. Unfortunately, they lose their taste and smell during this process. This is why manufacturers add aromatizers and other food additives. Because of this, we cannot say that the juice is 100% natural.</p>



<h3>Oat flakes aren’t a&nbsp;100% natural product.</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_58/584110/4302910-muesli-964142_1920-1507636360-650-c374c359be-1534758311.jpg" alt="10 Food Products That Can Be Surprising"/></figure>

<p><a href="https://pixabay.com/ru/%D0%BC%D1%8E%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%B8-%D0%BE%D0%B1%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%BE%D1%87%D0%BA%D0%B8-%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%B2%D1%82%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BA-%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D1%8C-964142/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">© pixabay.com</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many people think that oat flakes are not healthy. In fact, chemicals are sometimes used to dry oats faster. In 2010, in the USA, a lawsuit was filed against a well-known company that produces oat flakes. It contained ingredients hazardous to the health of people like trans fats. The company was accused of false advertising.</p>



<h3>Maple syrup isn’t always healthy.</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_58/584110/4302960-14809710-11-0-1508415220-0-1508484090-0-1508484588-1508484590-0-1534431689-0-1534433039-1534433042-650-1-1534433042-650-621e5f03aa-1534758311.jpg" alt="10 Food Products That Can Be Surprising"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://brightside.me/creativity-cooking/10-food-products-that-can-be-full-of-surprises-584110/#image4303660"></a></p>



<p><a href="https://pixabay.com/ru/%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD-%D1%81%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%BF-%D0%BF%D0%B8%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B8%D0%B5-%D0%B2%D0%BA%D1%83%D1%81%D0%BD%D1%8B%D0%B9-%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B5%D0%BA%D0%BB%D0%BE-2232088/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">© pixabay.com</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many people know that maple syrup is good for our health. It is considered a healthy alternative to sugar. But an inexpensive bottle of syrup may contain preservatives and artificial flavors.</p>



<h3>It’s difficult to&nbsp;find real olive oil in&nbsp;modern shops.</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_58/584110/4303010-pexels-photo-264821-1507636500-650-cd24de7c6c-1534758311.jpg" alt="10 Food Products That Can Be Surprising"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://brightside.me/creativity-cooking/10-food-products-that-can-be-full-of-surprises-584110/#image4303710"></a></p>



<p><a href="https://pixabay.com/ru/%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%BE%D0%B5-%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%BE-%D0%BE%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B2%D1%8B%D0%B5-%D0%BF%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D1%83%D0%BA%D1%82%D1%8B-1587579/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">© pixabay.com</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
