<p>Exercise is a great way to calm your eyes. If you want to increase the positive effect of these exercises, try masking your eyes. For example, there are only 3 ingredients in this guise:</p>



<ul><li>1 tbsp grated carrots</li><li> 1 egg white</li><li> Aloe 1 tbsp</li><li> Mix all ingredients in a bowl, coat the mixture around your eyes and leave the mask on for 15-30 minutes. Wash the mask with water.</li></ul>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_55/551410/2879060-40980310-newpreview-1531785932-1200-1-1531785932-728-b7ab97aeb6-1531811381.jpg" alt="Do Your Eyes Get Tired? Try These Simple Eye Exercises:"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://brightside.me/inspiration-health/take-a-break-and-do-some-refreshing-eye-exercises-for-tired-computer-users-551410/#image2879310"></a></p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>One day, constantly tired, I asked myself, &#8220;What do Japanese women do to get flawless porcelain skin, thin and toned shapes?&#8221; After doing a little research, I discovered the Japanese custom of drinking water on an empty stomach as soon as I woke up every morning.</p>



<p>According to many studies, this simple exercise has positive effects on various health conditions. I decided to give it a try, and today I want to share my experience with Bright Side readers.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know what to do to make it more powerful. My skin and hair seemed to be blurry and my body was sending me signs that it was not working properly.</p>



<p>Tired of visiting doctors who were telling me the same thing and prescribing more pills, I inquired about Japanese hydrotherapy and immediately put it into practice. The results are amazing!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_25/258710/7485310-3c14fe4b9f7a27c4f6bab1dad3_AzdlMzQ0ZjI0YjFk_alkaline-water-1476473524-650-bccefe92b7-1478596563.jpg" alt="Drink Water on an Empty Stomach for a Month &amp; See What Happens!"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://brightside.me/inspiration-health/i-drank-water-on-an-empty-stomach-for-a-month-and-heres-what-happened-258710/#image7485410"></a></p>

<h3>1. I&nbsp;started to&nbsp;feel more fresh and healthy.</h3>



<p>I started losing weight a few days after I started drinking water in the morning. I felt that my body was getting rid of toxins more easily.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Here&#8217;s some great news: All you need to do to stay healthy is to give up some bad habits, even when it&#8217;s cold outside.</p>



<p>If you stop doing the following nine things, you will not only get sick, but enjoy the cold weather to your heart&#8217;s content.</p>



<h3>Using nasal drops before going outside</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_26/267560/13361110-40857305-1-0-1479801461-1479801491-650-3-1488295420-650-5bd58ff264-1492090278.jpg" alt="Quit These Habits! If You Want to Stop Getting Sick in the Cold Weather"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://brightside.me/inspiration-health/9-habits-we-need-to-give-up-if-we-want-to-stop-getting-sick-when-the-weathers-cold-267560/#image13361560"></a></p>



<p><a href="http://www.kk.no/livsstil/jeg-var-som-en-narkoman-med-nesesprayen-28535" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">© kk</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.matterna.es/gripe-en-el-embarazo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">© matterna</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cold weather can make your nose narrow. If we give them a little &#8220;help&#8221; in the form of a runny nose, the mucous membranes will not protect us from microorganisms or the cooling air we breathe. It is advisable to blow the nose before you leave.</p>



<h3>Breathing through your mouth when outside</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_26/267560/13361160-40856405-1-0-1479801640-1479801645-650-3-1488295420-650-11e9e16134-1492090278.jpg" alt="Quit These Habits! If You Want to Stop Getting Sick in the Cold Weather"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://brightside.me/inspiration-health/9-habits-we-need-to-give-up-if-we-want-to-stop-getting-sick-when-the-weathers-cold-267560/#image13361610"></a></p>

<p>When you squeeze through your mouth, you cannot heat or moisturize the air, which increases the risk of angina. To prevent this, inhale slowly and deeply through your nose.</p>



<h3>Covering your nose and mouth with a&nbsp;scarf</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_26/267560/13361210-40856455-1-0-1479801701-1479801705-650-3-1488295420-650-eae394a2e6-1492090278.jpg" alt="Quit These Habits! If You Want to Stop Getting Sick in the Cold Weather"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://brightside.me/inspiration-health/9-habits-we-need-to-give-up-if-we-want-to-stop-getting-sick-when-the-weathers-cold-267560/#image13361660"></a></p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://m.ilmajaam.postimees.ee/?id=2680786" target="_blank">© ilmajaam</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://diarydiet.ru/vyberi-svoyu-masku-dlya-lica/" target="_blank">© diarydiet</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In cold weather, the water vapor we breathe becomes ice when we squeeze it directly into a scarf or coat material. The air that goes through your Iced Over Protective cover is much cooler than continuous. It causes angina and bronchitis and irritates your skin. If you really want to, you can hide your face, but don&#8217;t cover your nose.</p>



<h3>Running home when you’re shivering</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_26/267560/13361260-40856505-1-0-1479801757-1479801760-650-3-1488295420-650-40bc9bd9bf-1492090278.jpg" alt="Quit These Habits! If You Want to Stop Getting Sick in the Cold Weather"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://brightside.me/inspiration-health/9-habits-we-need-to-give-up-if-we-want-to-stop-getting-sick-when-the-weathers-cold-267560/#image13361710"></a></p>



<p><a href="https://www.google.ru/url?sa=i&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi93eD-kq3QAhUDGCwKHWOWDe0QjRwIBw&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fnews.tut.by%2Fsociety%2F326225.html&amp;psig=AFQjCNFRgnPklXNTec8iCnElxDw-_nvT_w&amp;ust=1479381006067209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">© TUT</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.peterburg.ru/city/shto-posmotret-v-peterburge-zimoy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">© peterburg</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the first signs of freezing, it&#8217;s best to leave somewhere warm (such as a shop or cafe) for a few minutes to warm up and squeeze, then continue on your way. Don&#8217;t go faster and faster when you&#8217;re already cold.</p>



<h3>Wearing tight-fitting clothes and footwear</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_26/267560/13361310-40856555-1-0-1479801890-1479801905-650-3-1488295420-650-e188a51fb3-1492090278.jpg" alt="Quit These Habits! If You Want to Stop Getting Sick in the Cold Weather"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://brightside.me/inspiration-health/9-habits-we-need-to-give-up-if-we-want-to-stop-getting-sick-when-the-weathers-cold-267560/#image13361760"></a></p>



<p><a href="http://movies.disney.ru/zolushka-animaciya?_ga=1.16236406.1754372450.1479296743" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">© Walt Disney Pictures</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>High-tight clothing and footwear guarantees that you will freeze quickly in cold weather. If you like things a little simpler, the air between the layers can help keep your body thirsty.</p>



<h3>Drinking something hot 30&nbsp;minutes before going outside</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_26/267560/13361360-40856605-1-0-1479801951-1479801955-650-3-1488295420-650-66f2d0287f-1492090278.jpg" alt="Quit These Habits! If You Want to Stop Getting Sick in the Cold Weather"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://brightside.me/inspiration-health/9-habits-we-need-to-give-up-if-we-want-to-stop-getting-sick-when-the-weathers-cold-267560/#image13361810"></a></p>



<p><a href="https://wallpaperscraft.com/download/croissant_drink_couples_84243/3840x2160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">© Wallpapers Craft</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://ru.depositphotos.com/65503395/stock-photo-glass-of-water-on-table.html?utm_source=Adme&amp;utm_medium=freesub&amp;utm_campaign=RU-brand" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">© Depositphotos</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hot tea boosts circulation and boosts your body&#8217;s immunity. But it also expands the blood vessels. When you get cold outside, you lose weight very quickly. If you really want a drink, it&#8217;s better to stay warm than warm water or hot.</p>



<h3>Going hungry when out in&nbsp;the cold weather</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_26/267560/13361410-40856105-1-0-1479802070-1479802074-650-3-1488295420-650-02ca95587d-1492090278.jpg" alt="Quit These Habits! If You Want to Stop Getting Sick in the Cold Weather"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://brightside.me/inspiration-health/9-habits-we-need-to-give-up-if-we-want-to-stop-getting-sick-when-the-weathers-cold-267560/#image13361860"></a></p>

<p>To produce body heat, we need energy, otherwise we freeze very quickly. That is why you should eat as soon as you feel hungry. At the very least, you should have a breakfast and a cup of hot tea somewhere in the heat.</p>



<h3>Applying cream immediately before going outside</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_26/267560/13361460-40856905-1-0-1479802136-1479802140-650-3-1488295420-650-c8a2f0f125-1492090278.jpg" alt="Quit These Habits! If You Want to Stop Getting Sick in the Cold Weather"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://brightside.me/inspiration-health/9-habits-we-need-to-give-up-if-we-want-to-stop-getting-sick-when-the-weathers-cold-267560/#image13361910"></a></p>



<p><a href="http://www.popsugar.com.au/beauty/photo-gallery/41566452/image/41566449/Sugar-Can-Cause-Skin-Inflammation-Dullness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">© POPSUGAR Photography / Maria del Rio</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://glupih.net/Woman/ShowItem/ustranyaem-osnovnye-oshibki-pri-nanesenii-makiyazha/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">© glupih</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When applying creams on the skin, they evaporate the first 30-40 minutes of water from it. In cold conditions, it can cool down and damage the skin. Therefore, avoid going out for at least 30 minutes after applying your cream or ion shade, or avoid using water-based creams.</p>



<h3>Warming up&nbsp;with alcohol when outside</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_26/267560/13361510-40856705-1-0-1479802199-1479802212-650-3-1488295420-650-d4916d643a-1492090278.jpg" alt="Quit These Habits! If You Want to Stop Getting Sick in the Cold Weather"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://brightside.me/inspiration-health/9-habits-we-need-to-give-up-if-we-want-to-stop-getting-sick-when-the-weathers-cold-267560/#image13361960"></a></p>

<p>You will feel the warmth for only 30-40 minutes after drinking alcohol. After this point, your body will cool down very quickly. What&#8217;s more, your brain does not respond enough to this danger, failing to send a signal that you&#8217;re cold. It is better to drink only on the inside.</p>

<p>Dissolve in salt water (the solution must be concentrated), soak in the towel solution and leave it on the face for 10 minutes.</p>



<h3>2. Make your lips appear fuller and sexier with an&nbsp;oil and a&nbsp;toothbrush.</h3>

<p>Peace Oil, Almond Oil or Regular Lip Balm &#8211; Apply any cosmetic oil on your lips. Then take a soft toothbrush and rub gently on the lips for 1 minute.</p>



<h3>3. Use olive oil to&nbsp;get glowing and moisturized skin.</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_27/277510/8160510-12-1480532585-650-bea1b670dd-1481908582.jpg" alt="10 Body Care Tricks You Never Know About"/></figure>

<p><a href="http://www.anekashare.com/category/kesehatan/page/5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">© anekashare.com</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Olive oil massage on the face helps keep the skin clean, soft, smooth and matte. First, steam your face and then massage it in the oil for 7 minutes. For best results, repeat this procedure every 4-5 days.</p>



<h3>4. Honey can help reduce inflammation and get rid of&nbsp;acne.</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_27/277510/8160210-6d19254e654daba431c9d5991df264c6-1481723188-650-191fc9cb94-1481908582.jpg" alt="10 Body Care Tricks You Never Know About"/></figure>

<p><a href="http://themetapicture.com/raw-honey-my-holy-grail-acne-treatment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">© themetapicture</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have acne on your face before a big date or an important meeting, there is a way to get rid of it quickly. Add some honey to the acne scalp and leave it for 15 minutes. Then rinse with lukewarm water. This method will help you reduce the size of the pimple and disregard it so that you can easily hide it with makeup.</p>



<h3>5. Use eye drops to&nbsp;reduce inflammation on&nbsp;your face.</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_27/277510/8160410-preimushhestva-masla-semyan-shipovnika-v-uhode-za-kozhey-1480533179-650-8e10aed068-1481908582.jpg" alt="10 Body Care Tricks You Never Know About"/></figure>

<p>Another way to get rid of pimples is to use eye drops. Soak the cotton pad in red eye drops and keep it in the freezer for 3-5 minutes. Gently press the cotton pad with warmth, and the pimples are almost unnoticed.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>To get rid of that extra weight, all you have to do is drop some habits and replace them.</p>



<p>To help you look better in just 4 weeks, we&#8217;ve added some recommendations on Bright Side. All of these things require less effort, but they can really change your look and appearance.</p>



<h3>Swap canned vegetables for frozen ones</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_22/220955/13225310-15167605-0103-1471427433-650-8-1488295420-650-1586de8f80-1492086223.jpg" alt="You May Have Tried A Lot Methods BUT! Try These Great Ways to Stay in Shape:"/></figure>

<p>Most of their vitamin content eliminates sugar and other preservatives added to canned vegetables. Frozen vegetables, by contrast, retain all of their healthy ingredients and contain no additives.</p>



<h3>Candied fruits and nuts instead of&nbsp;sweets</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_22/220955/6117505-b36a956499f21d6a2e3d62b391132814-1471442118-650-3ccfce08d1-1492086223.jpg" alt="You May Have Tried A Lot Methods BUT! Try These Great Ways to Stay in Shape:"/></figure>

<p>Replace cake and candy with fresh fruit, dried fruits and nuts. This way you can avoid excessive sugars and fats in your diet without leaving sweet things. Of course, you don’t have to eat a ton of fruit &#8211; there’s room for everything.</p>



<h3>Eat fruits with stones instead of&nbsp;seeds</h3>

<p>Peaches, nectarines and plums can help lower your cholesterol, so if you&#8217;re trying to lose weight, make them your first choice. Remember, however, that diatologists recommend only eating fruit for the first half of the day.</p>



<h3>Don’t use the elevator</h3>

<p>Whenever you go to a restaurant, you consume thousands of calories. If you have a salad with low-fat broth or a light dressing before you go out, you can easily reduce the amount you eat at the restaurant by 20-30%. For example, you may find that you eat fewer pizza slices than you eat completely. This will help you avoid getting 5-7 kg (11-15 ft) per year.</p>



<h3>Aromatherapy</h3>

<p>We have long known that different smells affect your appetite. For example, the smell of bananas, pears and apples can reduce your appetite and reduce the craving for something sweet. So if you want to eat that extra cookie, swap it out for pear or squeeze it into its smell.</p>



<h3>A&nbsp;light soup instead of&nbsp;a&nbsp;main course</h3>

<p>If you regularly decide to favor fat-free meat or vegetable-based soups instead of a heavy main course, a few pounds will quickly disappear. These will fill you up, but they are low in calories.</p>

<h3>1. Low-fat diets</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_23/239010/6792360-diet-695723_960_720-1473615775-650-2375a7adb9-1481542330.jpg" alt="Stop These Habits!! That Make You Age Faster"/></figure>

<p>To prevent wrinkles, you should take omega-3 fatty acids, which will help keep your skin soft and supple. A low-fat diet can cause the loss of this substance, leading to premature aging of the skin.<br>
Here are other foods that will allow you to stay young.</p>



<h3>2. Sipping through a&nbsp;straw</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_23/239010/8081760-ea442e31097c94a42c1c35dc60556026-1481542277-650-aa5a7f193c-1481542330.jpg" alt="Stop These Habits!! That Make You Age Faster"/></figure>

<p>When drinking drinks with straw, you should rinse your lips, which can cause stripes and wrinkles in your mouth. The same applies to smokers. Try to drink directly from the glass and do your best to quit if you are smoking. It is a long and arduous process, but the benefits of quitting smoking are huge.<br>
Here are other tips on how to maintain healthy skin.</p>



<h3>3. Sleeping on&nbsp;your side</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_23/239010/6792510-sleep-1209288_960_720-1473615934-650-38af593be6-1481542330.jpg" alt="Stop These Habits!! That Make You Age Faster"/></figure>

<h3>4. Bad posture</h3>

<p>Bad posture distorts the spine of its normal alignment, resulting in abnormal tension in the muscles and bones. These losses cause pain and fatigue and often lead to permanent disability.<br>
We recommend these exercises to improve your appearance.</p>



<h3>5. Using sun protection only on&nbsp;vacation</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_23/239010/6792110-F100008000-1473691476-650-d0bd9f6b5d-1481542330.jpg" alt="Stop These Habits!! That Make You Age Faster"/></figure>

<p>Excessive exposure to UV rays is the main reason for premature skin aging. To protect yourself from the harsh effects of the sun, it is important to wear your sunscreen even in cloudy weather, as clouds can block up to 20% of UV rays.<br>
If you want to tan without burning, consider these tips to secure the best suntan.</p>



<h3>6. Overusing your heating system</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_23/239010/6792160-open-fire-885860_960_720-1473732499-650-232bbd022f-1481542330.jpg" alt="Stop These Habits!! That Make You Age Faster"/></figure>

<p>Excessive use of artificial heating can make your indoor air very dry. Your skin and hair will become dry, resulting in more wrinkles. Try to reduce the heat in your home.<br>
We recommend reading this article for more tips on how to maintain healthy skin.</p>



<h3>7. Saying no&nbsp;to&nbsp;sugar</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_23/239010/6792460-bananas-282313_960_720-1473615996-650-8bba6f989d-1481542330.jpg" alt="Stop These Habits!! That Make You Age Faster"/></figure>

<h3>9. Lack of&nbsp;sleep</h3>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>At the beginning of the 21st century, bad posture is suffering. The persistent hunch-over position causes serious damage to their spine. Because of the constant use of smartphones and other handheld gadgets, many people can spend up to four hours a day in a pristine and vulnerable state.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why we decided on Bright Side to learn how to use your phone without harming your health. The following is invaluable advice for all of us!</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_24/241010/13871160-25561355-138540-1474902130-650-5-1488295420-650-d81043295b-1492264216.jpg" alt="Ways to Use Your Phone Without Damaging Your Neck / Posture"/></figure>



<p>Research has shown that a person&#8217;s position affects their emotional outlook. A person with clinical depression often takes a posture called ihanch. In the past, mainly elderly people sought medical help for back pain, but now doctors are looking at &#8220;growing young men&#8221; for this particular problem.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_24/241010/13871210-25562405-2-1474903569-650-4-1488295420-650-d81043295b-1492264216.jpg" alt="Ways to Use Your Phone Without Damaging Your Neck / Posture"/></figure>



<p>The main features of ihange are: extended neck, sunken shoulders, knee arms.</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Love conquers all. It breaks down barriers, eliminates mountains, crosses oceans and changes lives. There is nothing to overcome romance… except snoring, which is the third most common cause of divorce in the United States and Great Britain.</p>



<p>On the bright side, there are a few tips and tricks you can try to overcome this irritating habit &#8211; for bed and bed sharing &#8211; and may help your long-term partner get a good night&#8217;s sleep!</p>



<h2>It&#8217;s Surely not good to Snore! Try these ways:</h2>



<h3>1. Sleep on&nbsp;your side</h3>



<p>When you sleep on your back, the soft foot of your tongue and the soft palate come into the wall behind your throat, which can interfere with breathing and cause annoying snoring sounds. If you sleep on one side, it helps keep your throat open and there is a great chance it will stop.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_16/162355/1993605-man-909049_1280-650-a542d8629a-1484650732.jpg" alt="Do you Snoring While Sleeping or NOT? Don't Miss it!"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://brightside.me/inspiration-health/ten-great-solutions-for-those-who-want-to-stop-snoring-162355/#image9749360"></a></p>



<h3>2. Try to&nbsp;lose some weight</h3>



<p>This is similar to the previous point. If you are overweight, your lungs and neck may clog your airways, causing snoring. But this may be the least of your problems here, because being overweight increases the risk of sleep apnea.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://files.brightside.me/files/news/part_16/162355/1993855-pexels-photo-650-a542d8629a-1484650732.jpg" alt="Do you Snoring While Sleeping or NOT? Don't Miss it!"/></figure>



<p><a href="https://brightside.me/inspiration-health/ten-great-solutions-for-those-who-want-to-stop-snoring-162355/#image9749710"></a></p>



<h3>3. Blow your nose well before going to&nbsp;bed</h3>



<p>Breathing through the mouth often causes snoring, so it is advisable to squeeze through your nose. We recommend that you blow your nose well for this, and if necessary, use some nasal sprays to clear the airways before you go to sleep. An additional downside of this is that it improves your sleep quality.</p>



<h3>4. Use nose strips</h3>



<p>If you or your partner suffers from nasal congestion, you can try using special nasal piercings to lift, open and improve breathing, reduce or eliminate areas of your nose.</p>



<h3>5. Cure your crooked septum, rhinitis or&nbsp;any other medical problem</h3>



<p>If none of these snoring aids and remedies work for you, go to your doctor. Injured septum, chronic sinusitis, cysts and other medical problems can cause your bites and your doctor may advise you on how to treat them.</p>

<h3>6. Block up&nbsp;your ears</h3>



<p>If nothing works and your partner does not accept medical intervention, another option is to use earplugs to get you to sleep. Don&#8217;t use them every day as your ears need rest.</p>



<h3>7. Natural remedies</h3>



<p>There are plenty of natural antihistamines like nettles to cure fat. Drink two teaspoons of dried nettle leaves in two cups of boiling water for 10-15 minutes before bedtime. Mint tea before bedtime helps reduce allergies.</p>

<h3>8. Clean the house well</h3>



<p>Allergies are a major cause of snoring, so it is important to clean your home frequently, especially your bedroom. Vacuum and wash your curtains, sheets and corners.</p>



<h3>9. Watch your diet</h3>



<p>Believe it or not, it has a lot to do with snoring. Avoid heavy foods and alcohol before bedtime. Alcohol relaxes sore muscles.</p>

<h3>10. Sleep in&nbsp;a&nbsp;separate room from your partner</h3>



<p>Sleeping in separate bedrooms may seem a bit overwhelming, but ultimately it&#8217;s an effective way to ensure that both of you have extra hours of blessed sleep and that you are active and bright the next day. Another option is to lie in front of the bed &#8211; one on the head, the other on the head, and the other on the phone head.</p>



<p>If nothing works, don&#8217;t despair. It is possible to use timely sounds from your partner and they may even help you fall asleep!</p>

								<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The neck is a wonderful part of your body, but it has a tough job. This will increase the weight of the bowling ball all day. Along with the bones, muscles and tendons above your spine, support your head and weigh about 11 lbs.</p>



<p>It can be a delicate balance. From bad sleep to bad posture comes neck pain, as nearly a quarter of American adults are right to tell you.</p>



<h4>Most common Reasons:</h4>



<ul><li> When you drive or work on a computer the longer you get the pain in your head</li><li> Muscle tightness and illness</li><li> The ability to move your head is reduced</li><li> Headaches</li></ul>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter is-resized"><img src="https://images.medicinenet.com/images/article/main_image/neck-pain-2.jpg" alt="Do you also suffer from Neck Pain: Why Does My Neck Hurt?" width="647" height="438"/></figure></div>



<h2>What causes neck pain?</h2>



<p> Many things can cause pain in your neck:</p>



<ul><li>Bad posture</li><li> Repetitive movement</li><li> Poor sleeping habits</li><li> Gnashing of teeth</li><li> Bago has a huge shoulder</li><li> The nerves are pinched</li><li> Sports injuries</li><li> Accidents involving Whiplash</li><li> Arthritis</li><li> Nerve compression</li><li> Infection</li><li> Tumors</li></ul>



<p>How you handle it: With treatment, in most cases, your neck will get sore in a few days. Use drugs such as acetaminophen, aspirin or ibuprofen. Keep an ice pack on your neck for the first 2 to 3 days to help reduce inflammation. After that, a wet heat helps to heal like a hot shower or heating pad. There are exercises you can do at home (or in front of your computer at work) to stretch your neck muscles smoothly.</p>



<p>You may visit a chiropractor or massage your neck for short-term relief.</p>



<h3>Defense &amp; Preventions:</h3>



<ul><li> Use a good look. When standing up, make sure your shoulders are above the waist and your ears are above your shoulders.</li><li> Take a break regularly. If you have traveled long distances or worked long hours on your computer, get up and stretch your neck and shoulders.</li><li> Adjust your desk, chair and computer so that the monitor is at eye level. Knees should be slightly lower than hips. Use the armor of your chair.</li><li> Avoid placing the phone between your ears and shoulders as you speak. Use a headset or speakerphone instead.</li><li> If you smoke, quit. Smoking is associated with increased risk of neck pain.</li><li> Avoid packing heavy bags over your shoulders. Weight can put stress on your neck.</li><li> Sleep in good condition. Align your head, neck and body. Use a small pillow under your neck. Raise your thighs up on the pillows and try to sleep on your back, which expands the muscles of your spine.</li></ul>



<h3>When to concern a doctor</h3>



<p> If your neck pain is severe, does not respond to treatment, worsens over time, or has numbness, weakness, or pain in the limbs, call the doctor&#8217;s office.</p>



<h4>Questions to be asked by your Doctor:</h4>



<ul><li>When did the pain start?</li><li> Are you injured?</li><li> Do you have numbness or weakness in your arms or hands?</li><li> Does it tie your neck in a certain way and make it better or worse?</li><li> Does coughing or sneezing increase pain?</li></ul>



<p>Your doctor has many tools for understanding what is wrong. They may order an x-ray, MRI, CT scan, EMG (electromyography) or blood test.</p>



<p>Some treatments may include muscle relaxants, physical therapy, a soft neck collar or traction.</p>



<p>In rare cases, cortisone shots or surgery may be required.</p>
